Author: Rimsha Rizvi

## Description
This project showcases an AI agent learning to play the classic Flappy Bird game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The project is built using Python and the Pygame library.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python

## Features
- Game Development: Designed a Flappy Bird clone with realistic game physics and graphics using Pygame.
- AI Integration: Deployed a neuroevolution algorithm (NEAT) to train the AI agent.
- Performance: The AI agent mastered the game in only 21 generations.
